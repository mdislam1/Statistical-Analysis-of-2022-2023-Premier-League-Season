# Statistical-Analysis-of-2022-2023-Premier-League-Season

This project performs statistical analysis on the 2022-2023 Premier League season. It uses the pandas library to read in data from the website https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/Premier-League-Stats#all_rank_key, which contains statistics for all teams in the league. The script then filters and manipulates the data to include only relevant columns, and sets the team name as the index. Some of the key statistics it calculates include average points, average wins and losses, average goals scored and conceded per game, total goals scored and conceded, teams with the biggest goal differences, teams that scored the most goals, points per game per team, percentage of wins, losses and draws per team, and the difference between total points and available points. Finally, it creates bar charts to visualize the data.
